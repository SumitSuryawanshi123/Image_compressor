# Image Compression by using K-means Clustering

Image compression can be achieved through the utilization of the k-means clustering algorithm in machine learning. 
This implementation done without using Scikit-learn predefined functions. The process commences with taking an 
image as input and algorithm possessing the capability to reduce the image's size by eliminating thousands of 
unnecessary colours, condensing them into a count of one or two-digit colour variations.
